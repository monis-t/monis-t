## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Monis Tahir. 
### A Software Engineer and IT Consultant.
### My interests include Software, Hardware and Manufacturing.

### I'm currently working at the intersection of emerging tech, computers & people. I spend my time learning and implementing stuff in programming languages, helping people solve their IT problems and being a full-time IT support for my near ones. That's half truth, I also spends lots of time sleeping, eating and sitting at the beach for hours or maybe watching movies. I do go out, I'm not a hermit programmer.
I'm looking forward to share some ideas of my own and possibly help contribute to open source projects.
